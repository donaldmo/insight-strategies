An investment scheme where people can buy shares that will be converted into loans for the SMMes and the intrested recieved will be used to pay out investors
1. It can be run through  a central data base and will be one pool of funds and can be accesed by all different SMMes. 
2. Yes you can keep your shares because it will only grow over time because it will be split amonst the pool equally. 
3. I think the best way then is to set it up as a fund scheme so that people understand its more of a long term investment  e.g mutlichoice
It has a high default risk meaning some creditors wont pay so its best to set it up as more of a 10 year plus plan
You can also break it down it different  segments  short term, medium  term, and long term so to cater for their different needs, also their has been a high demand for business credit cards.
