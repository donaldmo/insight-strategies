Many grocery/ alcohol stokvels use big retailers usually found {in town} far from their townships, for their bulk grocery/alcohol sharing. For local retailers and taverns to get profit while the stokvels get all their desired goods. We will offer a platform where local businesses will advertise their bulk products and targeted stokvel products and stokvels can choose their desired shop and start saving with them. Usually, stokvels has a chosen day for taking their groceries therefore this will give the retailers enough time before that time to stock the products. They can also offer to deliver this product will appeal more to their customers. This does not only end at food retailers, but food business could offer to cater for events, this will be an expansion for other food business which will help create jobs and profit for their business. Our platform will create a database for the business that has all their customers details, and they will get a monthly report on how many new customers they gained, how many stokvels paid and who still owes for that month (they can choose to inform them or give them a period to clear their dept).
